# my new portfolio

this is my brand new portrfolio website, well, not really 'new'.
me and a friend made the original version of this last year, and moved on to bigger projects.
originally this was an encryption app with OS-like UI and an extremely fast custom FS-system and AES encrcyption.
I recently saw someone make an OS-like portfolio and remembered our old code was in react, so I
took the code and turned this project into my portfolio.

## how to run

this is just a simple vite app, to run the code just do the usual

```console
npm i
npm run dev
```

and the code should work
